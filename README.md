# Arnen Depay

A decentralized payroll platform for web3 Talent, integrating DEFI to power an interest-earning system on salaries. Easily and systemically pay for work done in the web3 space. It allows employees to earn a variable interest rate instantly from the get go.
We work everyday but don’t get paid until the end of the month. So it basically solves the problem of redundant earnings. Individuals can opt to earn interest on their pay.
Secondly, we strongly believe in the good faith of our companies to make the payments by the end of the month, sometimes they don’t and sometimes it is delayed. Having this platform takes care of both scenarios. Arnen Depay ensures talent are guaranteed of payment when due.
